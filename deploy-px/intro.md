Portworx is distributed file, block and object storage software purpose built for cloud native applications deployed as containers via a container orchestrator such as `Kubernetes`.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Learn how to deploy a basic 3 node Portworx Cluster.
2. Launch a `mysql` database and dynamically create a highly available PX volume.
3. Simulate a failover of a node and demonstrate high availability of the `mysql` database.
4. Take a snapshot of the `mysql` database and launch a second instance of `mysql` with the snapshot.
