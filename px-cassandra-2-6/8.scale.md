### Step: Scale the cluster

In this step, we will scale our Cassandra stateful set to 3 replicas to show how portworx Dyanamically creates new PVCs as the statefulset scales.

Run this command to add two nodes to the Cassandra cluster:
```
kubectl scale sts cassandra --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

You can watch the cassandra-1 and cassandra-2 pods get added:
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

You can ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to exit the watch and clear the screen. Now, to verify that Cassandra is in a running state you can run the nodetool status utility to verify the health of our Cassandra cluster
```
kubectl exec -it cassandra-0 -- nodetool status
```{{execute T1}}

It will take a minute or two for all three Cassandra nodes to come online and discover each other. When it's ready you should see the following output in from the `nodetool status` command (address and host ID will vary):

```
root@cassandra-0:/# nodetool status
Datacenter: DC1-K8Demo
======================
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address    Load       Tokens       Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack

UN  10.38.0.3  178.86 KiB  32           100.0%            ee7f6cb5-a631-4987-8888-28d008cfb959  Rack1-K8Demo
UN  10.40.0.5  101.46 KiB  32           100.0%            e2adf023-04f7-44a4-824b-55e75be7d74c  Rack1-K8Demo
```
When you see your Cassandra node is in Status=Up and State=Normal (UN) that means the cluster is fully operational.

### Pro Tip: Use jq to get useful cluster configuration summary

Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - it's awesome and very useful with Kubernetes and Portworx!
```
apt-get -qq install jq
```{{execute T1}}
Get the pods and the knowledge of the Hosts on which they are scheduled.

```
kubectl get pods -l app=cassandra -o json | jq '.items[] | {"name": .metadata.name,"hostname": .spec.nodeName, "hostIP": .status.hostIP, "PodIP": .status.podIP}'
```{{execute T1}}
