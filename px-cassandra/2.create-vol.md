In this step, we will create a Portworx volume (PVC) for Cassandra.

### Step: Create StorageClass

Take a look at the StorageClass definition for Cassandra: ```cat cassandra-sc.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that we define a replication factor of 2 to accelerate Cassandra node recovery and we also defined a group name for Cassandra so that we can take [3DSnapshots](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots/snaps-3d/) which will be consistent across the whole Cassandra cluster. In production environment which larger clusters you would also add the "fg=true" parameter to your StorageClass to ensure that Portworx places each Cassandra volume and their replica on separate nodes so that in case of node failure we never failover Kafka to a node where it is already running. To enable this feature with a 3 volume group and 2 replicas you need a minimum of 6 worker nodes.

The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. See [here](https://docs.portworx.com/manage/volumes.html) for a full list of supported parameters.

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f cassandra-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now that we have the StorageClass created, let's deploy Cassandra!
