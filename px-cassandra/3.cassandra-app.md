In this step, we will deploy a 3 node Cassandra application using a stateful set. To learn more about stateful sets follow this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

### Step: Create the Cassandra StatefulSet
Create a Cassandra [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) that uses a Portworx PVC.

Take a look at the yaml:
```cat cassandra.yaml```{{execute T1}}

Observe that the stateful set is exposed through a headless service. Also note how PVCs will be dynamically created with each member of the stateful set based on the `volumeClaimTemplates` and it's `storage-class` sections. Finally, you will also see that we are starting with a single node (replicas: 1).

Now use kubectl to deploy Cassandra.
```
kubectl create -f cassandra.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify Cassandra pod is ready

Below commands wait till the Cassandra pod are in ready state. Take note of the node it's running on.
```
watch kubectl get pods  -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

This takes a few minutes, when the cassandra-0 and cqlsh pods are in STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
