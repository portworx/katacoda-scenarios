In this step, we will install Zookeeper and Kafka using Helm. The Kafka Helm chart can deploy Zookeeper or point to an existing deployment. We chose to install separately because as of writing this tutorial the Kafka chart did not specifying the storage class for Zookeeper.

### Step: Install the Zookeeper chart

Use Helm to install Zookeeper, with name _pxzoo_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the _px-ha-sc_ storage class we just created. We also specify the memory and heap size so it can all fit on this Katacoda environment.
```
helm install --name pxzoo --set persistence.storageClass=px-ha-sc,resources.requests.memory=1Gi,heap=1G,servers=1 incubator/zookeeper
```{{execute T1}}

It'll take a few seconds and then Helm will report on the configurations it created. You will see that Helm creates a kubernetes secret, a service, a deployment, and a pod. To learn more about this Helm chart [check it out on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/incubator/zookeeper)!

Once Zookeeper is running we will be able to deploy the Kafka chart. Run the below command and wait for the Zookeeper pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all three Zookeeper pods are in STATE Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image.

### Step: Install the Kafka chart

Use Helm to install Kafka, with name _pxkafka_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the _px-ha-sc_ storage class we just created. We also specify the url and port for our Zookeeper.
```
helm install --name pxkafka --set persistence.storageClass=px-ha-sc,zookeeper.enabled=false,zookeeper.url=pxzoo-zookeeper,zookeeper.port=2181 incubator/kafka
```{{execute T1}}

It'll take a few seconds and then Helm will report on the configurations it created. You will see that Helm creates a kubernetes secret, a service, a deployment, and a pod.
