In this step, we will take a snapshot, simulate destroy our database, and recover from the snapshot

### Step: Take snapshot using kubectl

First, take a look at px-snap.yaml ```cat px-snap.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Notice it creates a new PVC that we will then use to recover from. Let's use kubectl to take the snapshot:

```
kubectl create -f px-snap.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

You can see the snapshots using the following command:
```
kubectl get volumesnapshot,volumesnapshotdatas
```{{execute T1}}

Now we're going to go ahead and do something stupid because it's Katacoda and we're here to learn.
Run the client and in a shell.
```
 kubectl run px-mongo-mongodb-client --rm --tty -i --image bitnami/mongodb --command -- mongo --host px-mongo-mongodb
```{{execute T1}}


Ok, so we deleted our database, what now? Restore your snapshot and cary on.

### Step: Restore the snapshot and see your data is still there

Snapshots are just like volumes so we can go ahead and use it to start a new instance of PostgresSQL. Note here that we're leaving the old instance to carry on with it's version of the volume and we're creating a brand new instance of PostgresSQL with the snapshot data!

First, lets create a new pvc, ``cat px-snap-pvc.yaml```{{execute T1}},  from the snapshot:
```
kubectl create -f px-snap-pvc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now, lets look at the yaml: .

Now let's deploy a second PostgresSQL that uses this new PVC, ```cat postgres-app-restore.yaml```{{execute T1}}, and make sure it came up.
```
kubectl create -f postgres-app-restore.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify postgres pod is ready

Below commands wait till the postgres pods are in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=postgres-snap -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod is in Running state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
