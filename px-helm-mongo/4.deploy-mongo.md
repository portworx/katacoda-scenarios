In this step, we will install Mongo using Helm.

### Step: Install the Mongo chart

Use Helm to install Mongo, with name _px-mongo_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the PVC we just created.
```
helm install --name px-mongo \
    --set auth.adminUser=persistence.size=1,\
    admin,auth.adminPassword=password,\
    persistence.storageClass=px-mongo-sc \
    stable/mongodb
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Wait for Mongo to start

Run the below command and wait for the Mongo pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the Mongo pod is in Running state then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image.
