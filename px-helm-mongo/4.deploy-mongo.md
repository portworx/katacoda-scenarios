In this step, we will install Mongo using Helm.

### Step: Install the Mongo chart

Use Helm to install Mongo, with name _px-mongo_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the PVC we just created.
```
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install px-mongo --set auth.enabled=false,persistence.existingClaim=px-mongo-pvc bitnami/mongodb

```{{execute T1}}

It'll take a few seconds and then Helm will report on the configurations it created. You will see that Helm creates a kubernetes secret, a service, a deployment, and a pod. To learn more about this Helm chart [check it out on github](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb)!

That's it! Isn't helm great? We think it is.

### Step: Wait for Mongo to start

Run the below command and wait for the Mongo pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the Mongo pod is in STATE Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image.
