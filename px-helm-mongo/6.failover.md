In this step, we will simulate failure by cordoning the node where mongoQL is running and then deleting the mongoQL pod. The pod will then be resheduled by the [STorage ORchestrator for Kubernetes (STORK)](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/) to make sure it lands on one of the nodes that has of replica of the data.

### Step: Simulate a node failure to force mongoQL to restart

You should make sure you exited the MongoDB client shell in the previous step and that you see the master$ prompt before you cordon the node where MongoDB is running to simulate a node failure or network partition:
```
NODE=`kubectl get pods -l app=mongodb -o wide | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $7}'`
kubectl cordon ${NODE}
```{{execute T1}}

Then delete the mongodb pod:
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=mongodb -o wide | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl delete pod ${POD}
```{{execute T1}}

Once the mongo pod gets deleted, Kubernetes will start to create a new mongo pod on another node.

### Step: Verify replacement pod starts running

Below commands wait till the new mongo pod is ready.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=mongodb -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod come back up it will be in the Running state. When it does hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Before you proceed you should uncordon your node:
```
kubectl uncordon ${NODE}
```{{execute T1}}

Now that we have the new mongo pod running, let's check if the database we previously created is still intact.
