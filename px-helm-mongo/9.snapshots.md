In this step, we will take a snapshot, simulate destroy our database, and recover from the snapshot

### Step: Take snapshot using kubectl

First, take a look at px-snap.yaml ```cat px-snap.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Notice that we create pre and post snapshot rules to ensure the snapshot is consistent. The pre-snapshot rule forces the mongod to flush all pending write operations to disk and locks the entire mongod instance to prevent additional writes until the user releases the lock with a corresponding db.fsyncUnlock() command. The post-snapshot rule releases this lock. Let's use kubectl to take the snapshot:

```
kubectl create -f px-snap.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

You can see the snapshots using the following command:
```
kubectl get volumesnapshot,volumesnapshotdatas
```{{execute T1}}

Now we're going to go ahead and do something stupid because it's Katacoda and we're here to learn.
Run the client and in a shell.
```
 POD=`kubectl get pods | grep 'px-mongo-' | awk '{print $1}'`
 kubectl exec -it $POD -- mongo --host px-mongo-mongodb
```{{execute T1}}


Remove all ships ```db.ships.remove({})```{{execute T1}} and confirm there are no ships left  ```db.ships.find({}, {name:true, _id:false})```{{execute T1}} and make sure to ```exit```{{execute T1}} the shell before continuing.

Ok, so we deleted our data, what now? Restore your snapshot and cary on.

### Step: Restore the snapshot and see your data is still there

Snapshots are just like volumes so we can go ahead and use it to start a new instance of MongoDB. Note here that we're leaving the old instance to carry on with it's version of the volume and we're creating a brand new instance of MongoDB with the snapshot data!

First, lets create a new pvc, ```cat px-snap-pvc.yaml```{{execute T1}},  from the snapshot:
```
kubectl create -f px-snap-pvc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now let's deploy a second MongoDB that uses this new PVC and make sure it came up.
```
helm install px-mongo-snap-clone \
    --set auth.enabled=false,persistence.existingClaim=px-mongo-snap-clone \
    bitnami/mongodb
```{{execute T1}}

Verify the new MongoDB pod is ready
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod is in running and ready state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
