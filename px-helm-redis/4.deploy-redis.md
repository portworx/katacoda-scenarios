In this step, we will install Redis using Helm.

### Step: Install the Redis chart

Use Helm to install Redis, with name _px-redis_ and with the _persistence.existingClaim_ parameter used to pass in the name of the PVC we just created.
```
helm install --name px-redis \
    --set redisPassword=password,persistence.existingClaim=px-redis-pvc \
    stable/redis
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Wait for Redis to start

Run the below command and wait for the Redis pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the Redis pod is in Running state then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image.
