In this step, we will simulate failure by cordoning the node where redisQL is running and then deleting the redisQL pod. The pod will then be resheduled by the [STorage ORchestrator for Kubernetes (STORK)](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/) to make sure it lands on one of the nodes that has of replica of the data.

### Step: Simulate a node failure to force Redis to restart

You should make sure you exited the redis client shell in the previous step and that you see the master$ prompt before you cordon the node where redis is running to simulate a node failure or network partition:
```
NODE=`kubectl get pods -l app=px-redis-redis -o wide | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $7}'`
kubectl cordon ${NODE}
```{{execute T1}}

Then delete the redis pod:
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=px-redis-redis -o wide | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl delete pod ${POD}
```{{execute T1}}

Once the redis pod gets deleted, STORK will work with Kubernetes to start a new redis pod on another node where the data has been replicated.

### Step: Verify replacement pod starts running

Below commands wait till the new redis pod is ready.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=px-redis-redis -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod come back up it will be in the Running state. When it does hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Before you proceed you should uncordon your node:
```
kubectl uncordon ${NODE}
```{{execute T1}}

Now that we have the new redis pod running, let's check if the database we previously created is still intact.
