In this step, we will check the state of our sample redis database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Run the client and in a shell.
```
 kubectl run redis-client --rm --tty -i \
    --env REDIS_PASSWORD=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --image bitnami/redis:4.0.8-r0 -- bash
```{{execute T1}}

 Once you get the command promt inside the redis-client container you can start the Redis cli.

 ```
 redis-cli -h px-redis-redis -a password
 ```{{execute T1}}


Now use the redis shell to make sure our data is still there:
```
get foo
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx replication makes handling Redis failover easy. ```quit```{{execute T1}} the redis shell and ```exit```{{execute T1}} from the client container shell before continuing.
