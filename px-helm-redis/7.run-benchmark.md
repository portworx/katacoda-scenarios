In this step, we will start a Redis benchmark and watch our volume grow and shrink!

### Step: Run a benchmark

Make sure you're still in the container shell for redis client and that you ```quit```{{execute T1}} out of the redis-cli session. Then run this command to start a benchmark with 1K payloads
```
redis-benchmark -h px-redis-redis -a password -d 1000
```{{execute T1}}

Now take a look at the volume in  _Terminal 2_ while this benchmark is running and watch it grow and contract.

```
ssh node01
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/pwx/bin
watch "pxctl volume inspect `pxctl volume list | grep pvc | awk '{print $1}'`"
```{{execute T2}}

Pro tip: you can pass the `-j` option to pxctl to get some more juicy details!

```
pxctl -j volume inspect `pxctl volume list | grep pvc | awk '{print $1}'`
```{{execute interrupt T2}}
