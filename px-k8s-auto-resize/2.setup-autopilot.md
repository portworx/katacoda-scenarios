Once Kuberentes and Portworx is Ready, we need to setup Prometheus and AutoPilot. AutoPilot uses metrics from Portworx that are made available in Promtheus to determine if it's rules are valid.

### Step: Make sure prometheus operator is ready.

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get po -n kube-system -l k8s-app=prometheus-operator
```{{execute T1}}

When it shows status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Install Portworx Monitoring.

First install Prometheus

```
kubectl create -f pwx-monitoring.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Next, wait for Prometheus to be ready.

```
watch kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep prometheus
```{{execute T1}}

When all the pods show STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Next, let's configure AutoPilot to talk to prometheus. The below configuration configured AutoPilot to talk to the local Prometheus running on the cluster. Let's take a look. Note the `url=http://prometheus:9090` defines this. If you have Prometheus running somewhere else, configure it here.

```
cat autopilot-cfg.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now, create it.

```
kubectl create -f autopilot-cfg.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now, we can bring Autoilot up.

```
kubectl create -f autopilot.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure Autoilot is up.

```
watch kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep autopilot
```{{execute T1}}

When all the pods show STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Now that we have the Portworx cluster up and running with AutoPilot, let's proceed to the next step !
