In this step, we will run a benchmark that uses more than 20% of our volume and show how AutoPilot dynamically increases the volume size without downtime or user intervention.

### Step: Open a shell inside the postgres container

Below commands exec into the postgres pod:

```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Next we can launch the psql utility and create a database
```
psql
create database pxdemo;
\l
\q
```{{execute T1}}

Use pgbench to run a baseline transaction benchmark which will try to grow the volume to a size that is greater than the 20% that we defined in our AutoPilot Rule. This should trigger AutoPilot to resize the volume.

```
pgbench -i -s 50 pxdemo
```{{execute T1}}

* Note that once the test completes, **AutoPilot will make sure the usage remains above 20% for about 30 seconds before triggering the rule.** Click ```exit```{{execute T1}} top exit from the pod shell before proceeding.

### Step: Check to see if the rule was triggered

We can retrieve events by using the `kubectl get events` and filtering for `AutoPilotRule` events that match our use case. Note, that AutoPilot delays the rule from being triggered immediately to ensure that the conditions stablize, so make sure to **hang tight and see the rule get triggered if you dont see it right away**.

```
watch kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=AutopilotRule,involvedObject.name=auto-volume-resize --all-namespaces
```{{execute T1}}

When you see `Triggered => Active` the action has been activated. When you see `Active => ActiveActionsTaken` this means the resize has taken place and your volume should be resized by **200%**. Hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Inspect the volume and verify that it now has grown but 200% capacity (3GB).

```
kubectl get pvc px-postgres-pvc
```{{execute T1}}

As you can see the volume is now  expanded and our PostgresDB database didn't require restarting.
```
kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

That's it, you're done!
