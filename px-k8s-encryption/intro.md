[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Marathon and Swarm. It is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create encrypted volumes using Portworx.
* How to set a cluster wide secret key
* Use the Portworx Storage Class encrypt all volumes created from this SC
* Use the Portworx PVC for per-volume encryption
* How to validate data is encrypted

### High Level Overview

First we will validate that we can use Kubernetes secrets to store our keys. Then we will create a cluster wide secret key. Next we will deploy Postgres to validate our encrypted volumes are being created. Finally we will do the same but with per volume encryption.
