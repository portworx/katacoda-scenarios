[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is the [cloud native storage](https://portworx.com/cloud-native-storage/) company that enterprises depend on to reduce the cost and complexity of rapidly deploying containerized applications across multiple clouds and on-prem environments. With Portworx, you can manage any database or stateful service on any infrastructure using any container scheduler. You get a single data management layer for all of your stateful services, no matter where they run. 

A popular [Kubernetes storage](https://portworx.com/use-case/kubernetes-storage/) and [Docker persistent storage](https://portworx.com/use-case/docker-persistent-storage/) solution, Portworx is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to resize a volume using Kubernetes "kubectl" cli:
* Use the Portworx Storage Class to create a PVC with 3 replicas of the data
* Use a simple YAML file to deploy PostgreSQL using this storage class
* Use pgbench to fill up the volume and use kubectl to resize the volume

### High Level Overview

First we will deploy PostgreSQL with replication factor of 3 and with io_profile=db. To learn more about io_profile settings please visit our [docs page](https://docs.portworx.com/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/performance-and-tuning/tuning/#global-performance-tuning).

Then we're going run a benchmark to fill up the database.

Finally, we will use kubectl to expand the size of the volume and re-run the benchmark.
