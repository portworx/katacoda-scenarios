[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Marathon and Swarm. It is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

In this tutorial, you will learn:
* How to deploy an application using Portworx volumes
* How to inspect the state of the volume
* How to validate data persistence by killing one instance of an application
