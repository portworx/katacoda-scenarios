First we need to wait for Kubernetes and Portworx to be ready. Be patient, this is not a very high performance environment, just a place to learn something :-

### Step: Wait for Kubernetes to be ready

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all 4 nodes show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.


### Step: Install [STORK](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/) and wait for Portworx to be ready.

Stork is a Cloud Native storage orchestration runtime scheduler plugin. It translates a scheduler's orchestration decisions into something that an external cloud native storage solution can act upon. By doing so, it extends Kubernetes with more stateful awareness of the underlying storage provider, it's capabilities and state.

Install STORK:

```
kubectl create -f stork.yaml
kubectl create -f stork-scheduler.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure all system containers are running:
```
watch kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all the pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Now that we have the Portworx cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !
