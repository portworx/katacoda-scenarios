In this step, we will initialize a sample database in our postgres instance.

### Step: Open a shell inside the postgres container

Below commands exec into the postgres pod:

```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD -- bash
```{{execute T1}}

Next we can launch the psql utility and create a database
```
psql
create database pxdemo;
\l
\q
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Run pgbench init to create some tables

By default, pgbench will create 4 tables (pgbench_branches, pgbench_tellers, pgbench_accounts, and pgbench_history) with 100,000 rows in the main pgbench_accounts table. This creates a simple 16MB database.

The -s option is used to multiply the number of rows entered into each table. In the command above, we entered a “scaling” option of 50. This told pgbench to create a database with 50 times the default size.

What this means is our pgbench_accounts table now has 5,000,000 records. It also means our database size is now 800MB (50 x 16MB).

```
pgbench -i -s 50 pxdemo;
```{{execute T1}}

Take a look at the tables and exit out of the container.
```
psql pxdemo
\dt
select count(*) from pgbench_accounts;
\q
exit
```{{execute T1}}
