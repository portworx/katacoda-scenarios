In this step, we will check the state of our sample postgres database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Below commands exec into the running postgres pod and dump our sample database.

First find the pod name and exec into the container.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD -- bash
```{{execute T1}}

Now use psql to make sure our data is still there.
```
psql pxdemo
\dt
select count(*) from pgbench_accounts;
\q
exit
```{{execute T1}}

Observe that the database table is still there and all the content intact!
