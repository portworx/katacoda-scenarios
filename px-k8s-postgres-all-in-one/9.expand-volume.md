In this step, we will run a bigger benchmark and run out of space to show how easy it is to add space to a volume dynamically.

### Step: Get into your PostgreSQL container and start creating more data

Open a shell inside of your container.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Use pgbench to run a baseline transaction benchmark which will try to grow the volume to more than 1 Gib and fail.

```
pgbench -c 10 -j 2 -t 10000 pxdemo
```{{execute T1}}

*You will see a lot of error messages, if you look at the first one it will say "No space left on device"

### Step: Expand the volume to accommodate the larger benchmark data set

This will run in _Terminal 2_ and get the volume id:
```
ssh node01
POD=`/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume list | grep pvc | awk '{print $1}'`
```{{execute T2}}

inspect the volume:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i $POD
```{{execute T2}}

As you can see the volume is within 10% of full and so we need to expand it using the following command:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume update $POD --size=2
```{{execute T2}}

We can now go back to _Terminal 1_ and run our benchmark again:
```
pgbench -c 10 -j 2 -t 10000 pxdemo
```{{execute T1}}

inspect the volume again on _Terminal 2_ to see it has expanded to 1.7 Gib size:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i $POD
```{{execute T2}}
