In this step, we will run a bigger benchmark and run out of space to show how easy it is to add space to a volume dynamically.

### Step: Run benchmark to make the database run out of space

Open a shell inside of your container.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Use pgbench to run a baseline transaction benchmark which will try to grow the volume to more than 1 Gib and fail.

```
pgbench -c 10 -j 2 -t 10000 pxdemo
```{{execute T1}}

* You will see a lot of error messages, if you look at the first one it will say "No space left on device". The pod is going to fail but that's ok, we'll let STORK reschedule it. If the pod doesn't faile you will have to ```exit```{{execute T1}} from the pod shell before proceeding.

### Step: Expand the volume and run benchmark again

Since we added the ```allowVolumeExpansion: true``` attribute to our storage class you can expand the PVC by editing the px-mongo-pvc.yaml file and then re-applying this file using kubectl.

```
sed -i 's/1Gi/10Gi/g' px-postgres-pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f px-postgres-pvc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Inspect the volume and verify that it now has 10Gi capacity:
```
kubectl get pvc px-postgres-pvc
```{{execute T1}}

As you can see the volume is now  expanded and our PostgreSQL database didn't require restarting.
```
kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

Now that you have expanded the volume you can go back to the step above and run the benchmark again.
