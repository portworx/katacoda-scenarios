[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Marathon and Swarm. It is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy Redis to Kubernetes and use Portworx Volumes to provide HA capability:
* Use the Portworx Storage Class to create a PVC with 3 replicas of the data
* Use a simple YAML file to deploy Redis using this storage class
* How to validate data persistence by deleting the Redis pod

### High Level Overview

First we will deploy Redis with replication factor of 3 and with io_profile=db. To learn more about io_profile settings please visit our [docs page](https://docs.portworx.com/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/performance-and-tuning/tuning/#global-performance-tuning).

Then we're going run a benchmark to create 5,000,000 rows in the database. Before simulating a server failure by deleting the pod running Redis.

Finally, when the pod comes back up Portworx works with the Kubernetes scheduler to make sure it gets scheduled where the data is available.
