In this step, we will check the state of our sample postgres database.

### Step: Confirm our nginx servers are up

Get webapp1 IP address and ClusterRole
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp1-svc | awk '{print $3}'``
curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}
Get webapp2 IP address and ClusterRole
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp2-svc | awk '{print $3}'``
curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}
Get webapp2 IP address and ClusterRole
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp2-svc | awk '{print $3}'``
curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Create index.html nginx html folder on webapp1

This command will run in a new terminal (2) and create index.html in webapp1
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp1 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exect -it $POD bash
echo "hello world" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```{{execute T2}}

Now let's try those three URLs again and see our hello world message is showing up on all three. This is because all three are attached to the same volume so updating one updates all three.

```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp1-svc | awk '{print $3}'``
curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}
Get webapp2 IP address and ClusterRole
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp2-svc | awk '{print $3}'``
curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}
Get webapp2 IP address and ClusterRole
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp2-svc | awk '{print $3}'``
curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Have some fun

Let's open a couple more terminals and have fun with shared volumes.

Open a terminal for webapp2 and touch ping
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp2 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exect -it $POD bash
touch /usr/share/nginx/html/ping
```{{execute T3}}

Open a new terminal for webapp3 and touch pong
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp3 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exect -it $POD bash
touch /usr/share/nginx/html/pong
```{{execute T4}}

We already have a terminal for webapp1 let's look at the files
```
ls /usr/share/nginx/html/
```{{execute T2}}


Observe that the database table is still there and all the content intact!
