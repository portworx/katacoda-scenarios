In this step, we will check the state of our sample postgres database.

### Step: Confirm our nginx servers are up

Get webapp1 IP address and curl
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp1-svc | awk '{print $3}'` && curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}

You should see the following:
```<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.13.8</center>
</body>
</html>```

### Step: Create index.html nginx html folder on webapp1

This command will run in a _Terminal 2_ and create index.html in webapp1
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp1 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
echo "hello world" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```{{execute T2}}

Now let's try all three URLs and see our hello world message is showing up on all three. This is because all three are attached to the same volume so updating one updates all three.

This will execute in  _Terminal 1_
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp1-svc | awk '{print $3}'` && curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp2-svc | awk '{print $3}'` && curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp2-svc | awk '{print $3}'` && curl $IP
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Have some fun

Let's open a couple more terminals and have fun with shared volumes.

Open a terminal for webapp2 and touch ping, this will execute in  _Terminal 3_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp2 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
touch /usr/share/nginx/html/ping
```{{execute T3}}

Open a new terminal for webapp3 and touch pong, this will execute in  _Terminal 4_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp3 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
touch /usr/share/nginx/html/pong
```{{execute T4}}

Now let's go back to _Terminal 2_ and see our ping pong files
```
ls /usr/share/nginx/html/
```{{execute T2}}


You can have some more fun by using terminals 2,3,4 to see how they all have shared data.
