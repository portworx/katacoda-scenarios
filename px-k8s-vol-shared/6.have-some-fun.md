In this step, we will play some file ping pong

### Step: Open some bash sessions in webapps 1-3

Let's open a couple more terminals and have fun with shared volumes.

Open a terminal for webapp1: _Terminal 1_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp1 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
echo "pong" > pingpong
```{{execute T1}}

Open a terminal for webapp2: _Terminal 2_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp2 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
echo "pong" > pingpong
```{{execute T2}}

Open a terminal for webapp3: _Terminal 3_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp3 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
echo "ping" > pingpong
```{{execute T3}}

Watch Ping - Pong Match between webapp1 and webapp2
```
tail -f pingpong
```{{execute T3}}

webapp1 is a pinger
```
while sleep 2; do  echo "pong" >> pingpong; done
```{{execute T1}}

webapp2 is a ponger
```
while sleep 1; do  echo "pong" >> pingpong; done
```{{execute T2}}

You can have some more fun by using terminals 1,2,3 to see how they all share data in the mounted /usr/share/nginx/html folder.
