In this step, we will install Zookeeper and Kafka using Helm.

### Step: Create StorageClass

Take a look at the StorageClass definition for Portworx: ```cat px-ha-sc.yaml```{{execute T1}}

The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. See [here](https://docs.portworx.com/manage/volumes.html) for a full list of supported parameters.

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f px-ha-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Install the Zookeeper chart

Use Helm to install Zookeeper, with name _pxzoo_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the _px-ha-sc_ storage class we just created. We also specify the memory and heap size so it can all fit on this Katacoda environment.
```
helm install --name pxzoo --set persistence.storageClass=px-ha-sc,resources.requests.memory=1Gi,heap=1G,servers=1 incubator/zookeeper
```{{execute T1}}

It'll take a few seconds and then Helm will report on the configurations it created. You will see that Helm creates a kubernetes secret, a service, a deployment, and a pod. To learn more about this Helm chart [check it out on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/incubator/zookeeper)!

Once Zookeeper is running we will be able to deploy the Kafka chart. Run the below command and wait for the Zookeeper pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the Zookeeper pod is in STATE Running and READY 1/1 you can hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Install the Kafka chart

Use Helm to install Kafka, with name _pxkafka_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the _px-ha-sc_ storage class we just created. We also specify the url and port for our Zookeeper. We will run with a single replica for now.
```
helm install --name pxkafka --set persistence.storageClass=px-ha-sc,zookeeper.enabled=false,zookeeper.url=pxzoo-zookeeper,zookeeper.port=2181,replicas=1 incubator/kafka
```{{execute T1}}

It'll take a few seconds and then Helm will report on the configurations it created. You will see that Helm creates a kubernetes secret, a service, a deployment, and a pod. To learn more about this Helm chart [check it out on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/incubator/kafka)!

```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the Kafka pod is in STATE Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
