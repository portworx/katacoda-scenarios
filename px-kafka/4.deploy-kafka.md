In this step, we will deploy Kafka using a StatefulSet.

### Step: Create Kafka ConfigMap and Service

We're going to create a ConfigMap and Service for Kafka.  First, take a look at these configurations: ```cat kafka-config.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that we are using the svc name for Zookeeper in our ConfigMap.

Now let's create them using kubectl:

```
kubectl create -f kafka-config.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Deploy Kafka StatefulSet

Let's take a look at the StatefulSet for Kafka: ```cat kafka-ss.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that the reference to our Zookeeper storage class in the VolumeClaimTemplate definition. Note that we're also only starting with a single broker, we will scale to 3 later in the tutorial. We are also going to deploy a Kafka CLI pod: ```cat kafka-cli.yaml```{{execute T1}}.

Now let's deploy Kafka and the kafka-cli pod:

```
kubectl create -f kafka-ss.yaml
kubectl create -f kafka-cli.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify that Kafka StatefulSet is finished initializing

The stateful set will create the kafka-0 pod and connect it up to our Zookeeper cluster. Please wait until the pod is in Running state before continuing to the next step.

```
watch kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

When the kafka-0 pod shows STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
