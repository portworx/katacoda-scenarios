In this step, we will start a kafka client and have some fun!

### Step:  Create a topic and send + receive messages on it


Start a bash sessions in the kafka-cli pod:
```
kubectl exec -it kafka-cli -- bash
```{{execute T1}}

Create a topic with replication factor of 1. We have Portworx doing replication in this lightweight single Kafka broker configuration. For larger clusters of Kafka the recommended approach is to use Kafka replication of 3 and Portworx replication of two. This gives you fast failover of any node in the cluster and reduces the total cluster size requirement to achieve the same level of service.
```
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper zk-headless:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
```{{execute T1}}

Now start a message producer and send a few messages:
```
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list kafka-broker:9092 --topic test
This is a message
This is another message
```{{execute T1}}

Now exit the message sender
```
Last message
```{{execute interrupt T1}}

And finally, create a consumer to see the messages have made it onto the test topic:
```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-broker:9092 --topic test --partition 0 --from-beginning
```{{execute T1}}

Once you're done make sure to ```clear```{{execute interrupt T1}} out of the producer and ```exit```{{execute T1}} from the client shell before continuing:
