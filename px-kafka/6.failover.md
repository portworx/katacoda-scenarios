In this step, we will simulate failure by cordoning the node where Kafka is running and then deleting the Kafka pod. The pod will then be resheduled by the [STorage ORchestrator for Kubernetes (STORK)](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/) to make sure it lands on one of the nodes that has of replica of the data.

### Step: Simulate a node failure to force Kafka to restart

You should make sure you exited the kafka client shell in the previous step and that you see the master$ prompt before you cordon the node where kafka is running to simulate a node failure or network partition:
```
NODE=`kubectl get pods -o wide | grep kafka-0 | awk '{print $7}'`
kubectl cordon $NODE
```{{execute T1}}

Then delete the kafka pod:
```
kubectl delete pod kafka-0
```{{execute T1}}

Once the Kafka pod gets deleted, Kubernetes will start to create a new Kafka pod on another node.

### Step: Verify replacement pod starts running

Below commands wait till the new kafka pod is ready.
```
watch kubectl get pods kafka-0 -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod come back up it will be in the Running state and are all READY (1/1) you can hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Before you proceed you should uncordon your node:
```
kubectl uncordon $NODE
```{{execute T1}}

Now that we have the new Kafka pod running, let's check if the database we previously created is still intact.
