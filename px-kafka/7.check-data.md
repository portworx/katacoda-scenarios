In this step, we will check the state Kafka broker once it has moved to a new node. Note that when it starts it will have all messages already on disk because we have been using Portworx replication to synchronously replicate data to 3 nodes. In large scale scenarios where you have multiple brokers and are using Kafka replication for high availability the broker would synch only those messages that it missed while it was down from the other brokers in the cluster. Without Portworx in that scenario the synching process would be much longer and would cause a lot of network traffic.

### Step: Verify data is still available
Open a new Kafka client session and check that our topic still has our messages:
```
kubectl exec -it kafka-cli bash
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-broker:9092 --topic test --partition 0 --from-beginning
```{{execute T1}}

You should see your messages replayed from the start. Make sure you ```clear```{{execute interrupt T1}} out of the consumer and ```exit```{{execute T1}} from the client shell before continuing..
