In this step, we will install Minio using Helm.

### Step: Install the Minio chart

Now we will use Helm to install Minio, with name _px_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the StorageClass we just created. For a complete list of available parameters check out the chart's repo [here](https://github.com/minio/charts).

```
helm repo add minio https://helm.min.io/

helm install px-minio \
    --set accessKey=myaccesskey \
    --set secretKey=mysecretkey \
    --set persistence.storageClass=px-ha-sc \
    --set persistence.size=10Gi \
    --set resources.requests.memory=1Gi \
    minio/minio
```{{execute T1}}

That's it! Isn't helm great? We think it is.

### Step: Wait for Minio to start

Run the below command and wait for the Minio pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the Minio pod is in Running and Ready 1/1 state then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image.
