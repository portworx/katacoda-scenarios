In this step, we will start a Redis client and have some fun!

### Step: Check that ETCD is running

The helm chart will have deployed a Kubernetes service so that we can contact Minio. Let's get the IP for Minio and write it to an environment variable.
```
MINIO_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl describe svc px-minio | grep Endpoints | awk '{print $2}')
echo $MINIO_ENDPOINT
```{{execute T1}}

Now let's download the Minio client and configure it with our endpoint.
```
wget -O /usr/bin/mc https://dl.minio.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
chmod +x /usr/bin/mc
mc alias set px http://$MINIO_ENDPOINT myaccesskey mysecretkey
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Create and query data

We can use the mc command line utility to upload data
```
mc mb px/yaml
mc cp *.yaml px/yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Check that the data is stored in the px bucket
```
mc ls px/yaml
```{{execute T1}}
