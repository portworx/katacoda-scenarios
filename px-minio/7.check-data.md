In this step, we will check the state of our sample Minio database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Since we're using the IP to access Minio and it has changed we need to reconfigure the client. In a real deployment you would have want to create LoadBalancer service to keep the URL constant.
```
clear && MINIO_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl describe svc px-minio | grep Endpoints | awk '{print $2}')
mc config host add px http://$MINIO_ENDPOINT myaccesskey mysecretkey S3v4
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify data is still available

Check that the data is stored in the px bucket
```
mc ls px/yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx replication makes handling Minio failover easy.
