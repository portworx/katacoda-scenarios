In this step, we will take a snapshot, simulate destroy our database, and recover from the snapshot

### Step: Take snapshot using kubectl

First, take a look at px-snap.yaml ```cat px-snap.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Notice it creates a new PVC that we will then use to recover from. Let's use kubectl to take the snapshot:

```
kubectl create -f px-snap.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now we're going to go ahead and do something stupid because it's Katacoda and we're here to learn.

```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
psql
drop database pxdemo;
\l
\q
exit
```{{execute T1}}

Ok, so we deleted our database, what now? Restore your snapshot and cary on.

### Step: Restore the snapshot and see your data is still there

Snapshots are just like volumes so we can go ahead and use it to start a new instance of PostgresSQL. Note here that we're leaving the old instance to carry on with it's version of the volume and we're creating a brand new instance of PostgresSQL with the snapshot data!

First, lets look at the yaml: ```cat postgres-app-restore.yaml```{{execute T1}}.

Now let's deploy it and make sure it came up.
```
kubectl create -f postgres-app-restore.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify postgres pod is ready

Below commands wait till the postgres pods are in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=postgres-snap -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod is in Running state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
